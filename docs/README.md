Krypto Kasino aims to develop a decentralised online poker platform, leveraging blockchain
technology to address the prevalent issues in traditional online poker platforms. The application will
provide an easy-to-use and responsive front-end interface for users, enabling them to enjoy an
engaging and secure online poker experience. The project will utilise React for front-end
development, Node.js for the back-end, and Solidity to create smart contracts on the Ethereum
blockchain.

The platform will allow users to connect their crypto wallets seamlessly, streamlining the process of
depositing and withdrawing funds. By using cryptocurrencies, the platform offers numerous
advantages over traditional payment methods, such as lower transaction fees, faster processing times,
and improved privacy.
